      I am Mofor Emmanuel, disciplined and enthusiastic Software Engineer with
      experience in planning, designing and developing professional websites,
      web apps, mobile apps, system software, utility programs etc...<br /><br />

      I intend starting this blog to develop my technical writing skills, share
      my ideas, tips mistakes and how I overcame them, and guides along my path
      in tech, and also write about topics, tools, methodologies which will go a
      long way to assist and inform the reader, thus making his own journey
      easier and better.<br /><br />

      I love learning, specially new tech, interacting with like-minded, if not
      greater-minded people, networking, pair-programming, working on embedded
      systems, electronics, mathematics, physics, astrology and of course,
      listening to, reading, and talking about the Word and Kingdom of God.<br /><br />

      I love singing, playing the piano, watching cartoons, romcoms, playing
      video games, hanging out with friends and doing fun stuff, (good, I must
      add). I'm not good at the drums, yet I always follow the beats, I'm not
      good with a solo guitar yet I got some amazing improvisation skills, I'm
      not good with the bass guitar but my baseline is so full and heavy it
      induces soundgasm. I'm not good with the sax, but my worship is angelic. I
      just love music so much that I code in a melodic rhythm, alternating wpm
      as a result of transitioning between minor, major, blues, jazz and
      pentatonic scales.<br />
      So much for a dramatic entrance &#x1F602;.<br />
      Oh, I'm an athlete too, football, basketball, table-tennis.

      <h2><span>Background</span></h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      As much as I'm fascinated by computers and what they did in the past, can
      do in the present and will do in the future, it never was something I
      wanted to do.<br /><br />
      Most of my childhood days, I'd spend time reading about cosmic phenomena,
      inter-galactic stuff, obsessing on finding constellations, star-observing,
      and all things space. Was an enthusiastic astronaut in the making
      &#x1F602;.<br /><br />
      At that time, I didn't even have a phone or access to the internet, so I
      would often get some of my elder brother's text books at the time (as he
      was reading Geology), and would overwhelm myself with content that I'd be
      so <q>ghoosebumpy</q> and in awe of the wonders of God's creation.<br />
      One of the books that got me engaged was
      <b>Macmillan Earth Science - <em>by Danielson Denecke</em></b>
    </p>

    <p class="my-3 mx-auto d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/macmillan-earth-science.jpg" height="auto"
        width="300" alt="Earth Science" />
    <figcaption class="text-center">Macmillan Earth Science</figcaption>
    </p>

    <p>
      As fascinating as the earth's composition, geology, geography and
      climatology was, earth beyond the ionosphere was like a thriller horror
      movie that you don't wanna watch, but are too anxious you can't afford to
      not know what happens next.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Cameroonian, with a not very wealthy background, I did dream big, but
      had to dream real too. I slowly realized the path I wanted to follow was
      literally beyond the stars, not impossible, but not feasible either, not
      even in the nearest future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then reduced my scope, from wanting to be an astronaut, to wanting to be
      a pilot. Got into aerodynamics at a young age, reverse engineered drones,
      studied flight mechanics and all that stuff. I wasn't very enthusiastic
      about that, so I felt down, gave up actually, and wanted to become a
      priest &#x1F602;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dude, I know &#x1F602;, the disappointments made me hear the call of God,
      dunno if that was real tho, but I was young. So I got into studying more
      about the Roman Catholic Church, became an Altar Server, and all the like.
      But then, as I was doing that, I realized I was good with electronics.
      Would reverse engineer so many gadgets at my house just to understand the
      underlying principle, have electronic circuits and boards littered all
      over, repaired phones, both hardware and software problems, then decided
      to study Mechatronics/Robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time I was a teenager, and never struggled with school, would
      always top my class even without studying, but wasn't very happy, cause
      when I started secondary school, my physics and maths teachers made me
      hate the subjects so much.<br />
      So when I was in form 3, I got sick. Meningitis. It was terrible. God did
      have my back, and I emerged victorious. It did some brain damage, that
      till date I still struggle a little, but I thank God for my life, cause
      I'm getting better and better. When I resumed school after I was
      discharged, I was like an average student. It sucked so bad. Got to form 4
      the next year, and there wasn't much progress. Luckily, the crisis
      outbroke, and we didn't go to school that year. Boy was I glad
      &#x1F602;.<br />
      The next year, we were all promoted, and after a year without school, it
      was kinda hard, but was fun to be back in action. Few months later, I
      started building solid grounds in mathematics and physics, science in
      general, was doing well for myself. It was a friend of mine told me about
      coding. For the curious and adventurous person I am, I got to research
      about it and started writing basic C++ programs. Luckily, Computer Science
      was our school curriculum, and basic C and HTML was one of the things we
      learned.<br /><br />
      I took the liberty to explore deeper, and studied about web development,
      where I built my first big static website (livescore clone), with no
      mentorship, tutorials or guidance, just intuition. But sadly that time, I
      use the File protocol to serve my files, didn't know about the HTTP
      protocol, or about indepth servers, version control or anything. I
      actually practiced file system version control without knowing what it
      was. But I lost all these, as I didn't have a laptop and was using my
      elder sister's laptop at the time. I got discouraged and discontinued.
      <br /><br />
      When I got to high school, I was so damn good in maths, physics and
      computer science. That I took them as major courses. Here, I self-studied
      C up to structures and unions, and often mentored fellow comrades. Cut the
      story short, Since I couldn't study Robotics, cause the field wasn't
      available in my country, I said to myself
      <b><q>If I can't build a robot or related systems, I'll build their
          brains.</q></b>
      So I went in for Computer Engineering in the University, where my tech
      career began officially; here we are &#x1F603;.
