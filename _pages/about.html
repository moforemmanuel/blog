      I am Mofor Emmanuel, disciplined and enthusiastic Software Engineer with
      experience in planning, designing and developing professional websites,
      web apps, mobile apps, system software, utility programs etc...</p>

    <p>I intend starting this blog to develop my technical writing skills, but not just that. I intend to share
      my ideas, tips, mistakes and how I overcame them as a developer, and guides along my path
      in tech, and also write about tech and related topics, tools, methodologies which will go a
      long way to assist and inform you, thus making your own journey
      easier and better.</p>

    <p>Contributions are very much welcomed.</p>

    <p>I love learning, specially new tech, interacting with like-minded, if not
      greater-minded people, networking, pair-programming, working on embedded
      systems, electronics, mathematics, physics, mechanics, astrology and of course,
      listening to, reading, and talking about the Word and Kingdom of God.</p>

    <p>I love singing, playing the piano, watching cartoons, romcoms, playing
      video games, hanging out with friends and doing fun stuff. I also engage in sporting activities, football,
      basketball, table-tennis.

      <h2><span>Background</span></h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      As much as I'm fascinated by computers and what they did in the past, can
      do in the present and will do in the future, it never was something I
      wanted to get into.</p>
    <p>
      Spent some of my childhood days reading about cosmic phenomena, supernovas, black holes,
      inter-galactic stuff, obsessing on finding constellations, star-observing,
      and all things space. Was an enthusiastic astronaut in the making.</p>
    <p>
      At that time, I didn't even have a phone or access to the internet, so I
      would often get some of my elder brother's text books at the time (as he
      was reading Geology), and would overwhelm myself with content that I'd be
      so <q>ghoosebumpy</q> and in awe of the wonders of God's creation.<br />
      One of the books that got me engaged was
      <b>Macmillan Earth Science - <em>by Danielson Denecke</em></b>
    </p>

    <p class="my-3 mx-auto d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/about/macmillan-earth-science.jpg" height="auto"
        width="300" alt="Earth Science" />
    <figcaption class="text-center">Macmillan Earth Science</figcaption>
    </p>

    <p>
      As fascinating as the earth's composition, geology, geography and
      climatology was, earth beyond the ionosphere was like a thriller horror
      movie that you're scared to watch, but also too anxious to want to know what happens next.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Cameroonian, I did dream big, but
      had to dream real too. I slowly realized the path I wanted to follow was
      literally beyond the stars, not impossible, but not feasible either, not
      even in the nearest future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then reduced my scope, from wanting to be an astronaut, to wanting to be
      a pilot. Got into aerodynamics and all things flight, reverse engineered drones,
      studied flight mechanics and all that stuff, was mentally immature to handle the advanced stuff, but was beyond
      average. I
      wasn't very enthusiastic
      about it, so I gave up eventually. Then wanted to become a
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I got into studying more
      about the Roman Catholic Church, became an Altar Server, and all the like.
      But then, as I was doing that, I realized I was good with electronics.
      Would reverse engineer so many gadgets at my house just to understand the
      underlying principle, having electronic circuits and boards littered all
      over, repaired phones, both hardware and software problems, then decided
      to study Mechatronics/Robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time I was a teenager, and never really struggled with school. I'd
      always top my class even without studying, but wasn't very satisfied at times, cause
      when I started secondary school, my Physics and Math teachers made me
      hate the subjects so much.<br />
      So when I was in form 3, I got sick. Meningitis. It was terrible. God did
      have my back, and I emerged victoriously. It cause some brain damage though, that
      till date I still struggle a little, but I thank God for my life, cause
      I'm getting better and better.<br />
      When I resumed school after I was
      discharged, I was like an average student. It sucked so bad. Got to form 4
      the next year, and there wasn't much progress. Luckily, the crisis
      outbroke, and we didn't go to school that year. Boy was I glad
      &#x1F602;.<br />
      The next year, we were all promoted, and after a year without school, it
      was kinda hard, but was fun to be back in action. Few months later, I
      started building solid grounds in Mathematics and Physics, science in
      general, was doing well for myself. Then a friend of mine told me about
      coding, shared his experience and what he could do. I was fascinated, and for the curious and adventurous person
      I am, I got to research
      about it and started writing basic C++ programs. Luckily, Computer Science
      was part of our school curriculum, and basic C, Logical programming with Scratch and HTML were some of the things
      we
      learned at the time.<br /><br />
      I took the liberty to explore deeper, and studied about web development,
      where I built my first big static mobile-unfriendly website (livescore clone), with no
      mentorship, tutorials or guidance, just intuition. But sadly that time, I
      used the File protocol to serve my files, didn't know about the HTTP
      protocol, or about servers, version control or anything to better and/or simply development. I
      actually practiced file system version control without knowing what it
      was. But I lost all my files when the laptop got bad, HDD had to be cleaned, and it wasn't the SATA models that
      had external cases one could connect to and access files on a different computer.
      This HDD was one of those old models that had so many pins on them that it was frightful. The kind that you either
      use it in the laptop or you throw it away. I was using my
      elder sister's laptop by the way. I got discouraged and discontinued.
      <br /><br />
      When I got to high school, I was so damn good in maths, physics and
      computer science, that I took them as major courses. I then self-studied
      C up to structures and unions, cause beyond that was just stuff I didn't see myself using. I also often mentored
      fellow
      classmates on programming. Cut the
      story short, Since I couldn't study Robotics, cause the field wasn't
      available in my country, I said to myself
      <b><q>If I can't build a robot or related systems, I'll build their
          brains.</q></b>
      So I went in for Computer Engineering in the University, where my tech
      career began officially; here we are.
      I look back at my journey and see how far I've come. I might not be there yet, but I'm not where I was either. The
      advanced C Language I used to not very much like, I now
      use for Systems Programming and interacting with the Linux Kernel and related ABIs.
      I now build mobile friendly and highly response websites and applications, secure and highly performant backend
      APIs, Microservices and so much more. Learning truly never
      ends.
